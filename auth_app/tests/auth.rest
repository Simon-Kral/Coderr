# 
# Description
# 
# This file can be used to send HTTP-Requests and view the response in Visual Studio Code directly.
# Install Rest-Client Extension for Visual Studio Code to use this test-file:
# https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client
# 
# 
# Usage
# 
# Enter a valid {@token} and hit the 'Send-Request'-button above the request with the django-server running.
# The 'registration/'- and 'login/'-endpoints do not require a token.
# The response will be previewed in a separate webview panel of Visual Studio Code.
# 
# 
# Token
# 
# Some requests require a valid API-Token.
# You will get a token by sending a POST-request to the 'registration/'-endpoint with valid credentials.
# You can use the first request of the auth.rest file in the auth_app-folder.
# Just replace the value of the @token-variable below with the token of the response.
# 
# 
# Caution
# 
# Keep in mind, that these are real requests and there is no test database.
# The requests will alter the data of the projects database.
# 
#
